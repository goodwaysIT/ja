## Event Description  
A SQL execution remained in ACTIVE state (the SQL contained CONNECT BY / regexp_substr) with wait time attributed to PGA memory operation.
This SQL executed normally in the test environment (Oracle 19.3), but failed to execute in the production environment (Oracle 19.7).

## Subsequent Analysis Steps  
Through analysis of the SQLHC information for SQL: c9333k2g237qx, this SQL did execute for a very long time, but the time was spent on CPU Time, with no significant long-term PGA memory operation wait event observed.
The issue might lie in the execution plan, table size, statistics, or differences in bind variables passed. We need to compare the execution status in your mentioned test environment. Please provide the following information.  

1. Collect SQLHC for this SQL in the test environment (Oracle 19.3).  
2. Collect 10046 and 10053 trace for this SQL statement in both the test and production environments.  

```SQL
SQL> connect executing_user  
SQL> alter session set max_dump_file_size = UNLIMITED;  
SQL> alter session set timed_statistics=true;  
SQL> alter session set events '10053 trace name context forever, level 2';  
SQL> alter session set events '10046 trace name context forever, level 12';  
```

Execute the statement to reproduce the issue.  
If the execution time is very long, forcibly interrupt it after 10-20 minutes.  
```SQL
SQL> alter session set events '10046 trace name context off';
SQL> alter session set events '10053 trace name context off';
```

List the trace files using the statement below  
```SQL
SQL> select * from v$diag_info where NAME in ('Default Trace File', 'Diag Trace')
```

3. DB alert logs from the production environment during the time period when the statement was executed.  

4. Execute the following queries in both test and production environments and provide the results.  
```SQL
spool /tmp/test or product.html
set markup html on
set time on
alter session set nls_date_format='dd-mon-yyyy hh24:mi:ss';
SELECT * FROM DBA_TAB_STATISTICS where TABLE_NAME='EARLY_CONFIG_SP_TASK';
SELECT * FROM DBA_IND_STATISTICS where TABLE_NAME='EARLY_CONFIG_SP_TASK';
SELECT * FROM DBA_TAB_COL_STATISTICS where TABLE_NAME='EARLY_CONFIG_SP_TASK';
SELECT * FROM DBA_OPTSTAT_OPERATIONS where START_TIME >=to_date('2024-06-17 00:00:00','yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss') and END_TIME <= to_date('2024-06-24 01:00:00','yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss') order by START_TIME;
SELECT * FROM DBA_TAB_STATS_HISTORY where TABLE_NAME='EARLY_CONFIG_SP_TASK';
set markup html off
spool off
```

## Issue Summary  
Subsequent analysis revealed that the data volume differed between the test environment (19.3) and production environment (19.7).  
The SQL also failed to execute in the test environment with the same data. After development modified the SQL (adding new filtering conditions), the SQL executed normally.
